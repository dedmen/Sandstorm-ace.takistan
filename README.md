Insurgency style mission for Takistan, complete with all the tools you need for a full MILSIM experience.
This is the 1st edition of the mission and is a WIP, a unique experience. This mission is designed for a multiplayer environment, however you can also enjoy it in single player. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
